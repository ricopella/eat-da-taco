### Overview

# Getting Started

* Eat-Da-Taco! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a taco's name, it's displayed on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each taco in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every taco in a database, whether devoured or not.
