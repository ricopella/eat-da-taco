# eat-da-taco

### Overview

* Eat-Da-Taco! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a taco's name, it's displayed on the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each taco in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco will.

* Every taco is saved in a database, whether devoured or not.
